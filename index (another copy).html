    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! I studied Electronics and Microsystems Engineering at OTH Regensburg, where I discovered my deep enthusiasm for robotics, automation, and embedded systems. I am passionate about exploring intelligent technologies that bridge hardware and software to bring machines to life. My curiosity and dedication have driven me to continuously learn, build, and contribute to impactful projects in the field of autonomous systems.</p>

    <p>My professional journey started with a strong foundation in electronics and communication, combined with a growing interest in mechatronics. Over time, I developed hands-on experience in programming with C, C++, Python, and working in embedded systems and Linux environments. My work spans robotic system integration, environment perception, and automation. From contributing to the AdLabSens project—where I integrated radar sensors into automotive systems—to building autonomous vehicle solutions for Formula Student-Dynamics EV using ROS2, LiDAR, GPS, IMU, and SLAM technologies, I’ve explored both the research and practical sides of robotics. My experience also includes an IoT- and fiber optics–focused internship with Indian Railways, various personal robotics projects like a gyro-sensor robotic car and home automation, and enterprise experience as an SAP Security Consultant at Capgemini, where I worked on security protocols and enterprise automation.</p>
        
    <p>I love working on robotics systems, graphical simulations, and hardware-software integration. My interests lie particularly in environment perception sensors, control systems, and algorithms. With a knack for technical exploration and a natural drive to problem-solve, I enjoy building robotic prototypes, supporting research experiments, and continuously learning new technologies and tools in the automation and robotics space.</p>
        
    <p>When I am not working, I enjoy diving into the latest robotics research online, traveling to new places, playing PC games, and performing Bhangra — a traditional folk dance from Punjab. These activities keep me energized and curious, balancing my technical passions with fun and creativity.</p>
